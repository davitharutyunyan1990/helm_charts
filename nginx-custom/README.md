# NGINX (fake readme, text bits copied from bitnami)

[NGINX](https://nginx.org) (pronounced "engine-x") is an open source reverse proxy server for HTTP, HTTPS, SMTP, POP3, and IMAP protocols, as well as a load balancer, HTTP cache, and a web server (origin server).

You can use the `serverBlock` value to provide a custom server block for NGINX to use. To do this, create a values files with your server block and install the chart using it:

```yaml
serverBlock: |-
  server {
    listen 0.0.0.0:8080;
    location / {
      return 200 "hello!";
    }
  }
```

> Warning: The above example is not compatible with enabling Prometheus metrics since it affects the `/status` endpoint.
